Works on Android version 3.0 devices and above (originally intended to work on 2.2 and above, but late testing on 2.3 device revealed app didn't work at all on it, so support for devices below 3.0 abandoned).

Enhancements/improvements
• Make it easier to touch on article links (title/status bar hiding functionality impedes that now)
• Create Article class and objects to hold information from xml, instead of the several arraylists currently used
• Save content, and which article is in view, for offline reading, and handle not having a connection to the Internet better--maybe don't automatically load content from the URL (if there's content saved locally), but provide a refresh option, maybe from the action bar.
• Maybe forward (and back?) buttons to navigate between articles (or ability to swipe between articles), without having to select next article from list.
• Ability to play embedded video
