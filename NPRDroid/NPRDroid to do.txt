¥ Player buttons (rewind, play, pause, next)
	- Implement next button pressed (so user knows that it's been pressed)
	- Activate and change graphic for rewind button, and make it move story back X seconds (X = 10, 30?)
	- Combine play and pause buttons into 1 button that toggles between the play and pause button images appropriately

¥ Format each list entry better (show, well-formatted date, size or duration)
¥ Don't add story to list if size is 0 KB
¥ Put more space between stories in list

¥ Figure out how to handle saved position between app uses (set to 0 when a download is performed? have play button play highlighted story otherwise (right now play button just starts from first story when app started up fresh))

¥ Warn user when there's no Internet connection (take them to settings?)
¥ What happens when stories downloaded while audio is playing, and how should that be handled?
