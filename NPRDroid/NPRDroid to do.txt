¥ Player buttons (play/pause, next, previous, rewind(?), FF(?))
¥ Change radio buttons and single download button to 2 buttons (one for each show) and a heading ("Download today's stories")
¥ Have downloads and audio continue when app not in foreground
¥ Highlight story in list that's currently playing
¥ Story titles instead of file names in story list
¥ File mod dates in story list
¥ Shorten download-URL display (just show text after last slash, maybe with easier to read date)
¥ Figure out how many stories are available and only download those (download loop arbitrarily set to 30 now) 

Done
¥ Fix next story not starting when previous ends
