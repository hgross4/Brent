What I've learned in doing this challenge:

• How to use a library like Ion, which was very useful

• More about parsing JSON 
(I got confused when trying to troubleshoot a nullpointerexception when trying to put the comments in the list, and got pretty deep into trying to understand the JSON structure, ultimately realizing that the first element of the returned array is not a comment.)
How to make an app that works on both phones and tablets. (I'd really only created apps for one or the other before.)

• More about using the ActionBar and making it compatible with devices running earlier versions of Android (pre-4.x). Note that I originally had a Button widget for the refresh button, but couldn’t get its click to register (not via the normal mechanism in onOptionsItemSelected nor by implementing onClick on it), so I just used a .png that I put in the drawable folder. The problem with that is that it looked much smaller or larger depending on device, but I left that implementation rather than getting bogged down in getting the button onClick working.
